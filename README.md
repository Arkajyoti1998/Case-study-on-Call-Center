Problem Introduction<br>
RBS, being large public sector bank, needs to get its accounts audited periodically for public reporting. During audit, in addition to conduct quarterly, half yearly and annual audits, the Board of Directors of the Bank randomly chose the accounts of a certain year to be audited for in-depth assessment of regularities in processes and accounts. This additional activity is done to ensure:<br>
● Any past irregularities by the then auditors<br>
● Any irregularity that was missed in earlier reporting<br>
● To account for any unknown/ unaccounted cash excess and/ or shortfall<br>
<br>
